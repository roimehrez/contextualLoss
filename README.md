# The Contextual Loss [[project page]](https://cgm.technion.ac.il/Computer-Graphics-Multimedia/Software/Contextual/)

This is a Tensorflow implementation of the Contextual loss function as reported in the following papers:
(PyTorch implementation is also available - see bellow)

## Setup

### Background
This code is mainly the contextual loss function. The two papers have many applications, here we provide only one applications: animation from single image.

An example pre-trained model can be download from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/37nz4hy7ai4pqxc/single_im_D32_42_1.0_DC42_1.0.zip?dl=0)

The data for this example can be download from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ggb6v6rv1a0212y/single.zip?dl=0)

### Requirement
Required python libraries: Tensorflow (>=1.0, <1.9,  tested on 1.4) + Scipy + Numpy + easydict

Tested in Windows + Intel i7 CPU + Nvidia Titan Xp (and 1080ti) with Cuda (>=8.0) and CuDNN (>=5.0). CPU mode should also work with minor changes.


### Quick Start (Testing)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the pretrained model from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q3wjtaxr76cdx3t/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat?dl=0)
3. Extract the zip file under ```result``` folder. The models should be in ```based_dir/result/single_im_D32_42_1.0_DC42_1.0/```
3. Update the ```config.base_dir``` and ```config.vgg_model_path``` in ```config.py``` and run: ``` single_image_animation.py```

### Training
1. Change ```config.TRAIN.to_train``` to ```True```
2. Arrange the paths to the data, should have ```train``` and ```test``` folders
2. run ``` single_image_animation.py ``` for 10 epochs. 

### Pytorch implemntation
We have also released a PyTorch implementation of the loss function. See ```CX/CX_distance.py```. Note that we havn't test this implemntation to reproduce the results in the paper.
